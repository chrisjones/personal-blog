<p>I grew up a military brat and went into the Air Force myself for seven years. Since then I have been a multi-time Director of Information Technology and have experience in the Government, Finance, Manufacturing, and Distribution verticals. I have a Bachelors of Science with Mathematics minor from the University of Alabama (Roll Tide!) and a Masters of Business Administration in Finance from Auburn University in Montgomery (still Roll Tide!).<p>

<p>In 2016, I started my own Consulting firm, <a href="https://rezenent.com/">Rezenent</a>, focusing on Analytics and Business Intelligence, and in 2019, Machine Learning. I have so far released one product, <a href="https://sentigrade.io">Sentigrade.io</a> - a text sentiment analyzer. I am also co-founder of <a href="https://www.planitdr.com/">PlanITDR</a> - a disaster recovery documentation system.<p>

<p>Security is also my passion - I've held a current CISSP certification since 2005 - and subcontract to several multiple companies as a Primary Incident Responder and Senior Penetration Tester.</p>
	
<p>I live in Birmingham, AL with my beautiful wife Kristin and our three kids, Hayes, Emmie, and Mollie.</p>
