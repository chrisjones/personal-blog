<h3>One month Update on Sentigrade.io</h3>

One month in from publically releasing our $29 plan and I'm amazed. My admin dashboard tonight looks like this for scoring text with our Sentiment Analyzer for the past 30 days:

![2019-08-16 Sentigrade](/images/20190816-sentigrade-stats.png){:width="100%"}

SEO is starting to pick up, too, with a third of my traffic coming from Bing or Google. That's going to make me hold back on AdWords and other paid advertising for a little while longer.

Stunned and psyched at just the 30 day metrics for my first solo product. 

Cheers!
