<h2 style="margin-left:1px;">Visits  x  Conversion Rate  x  Average Order Value  =  Revenue</h2>

I promise this is the only math you need to know to manage your eCommerce website. Let’s look at some quick definitions:

<ul>
<li>Visits. The number of times people, or visitors, come to your website.</li>
<li>Conversion Rate. The percentage of web visits that lead to a transaction.</li>
<li>Average Order Value. The average shopping cart value across all transactions.</li>
<li>Revenue. The money your website brings in from selling services and goods.</li>
</ul>

A new idea is always better with an example:

|      				|  Visits 	| x Conversion Rate 	| x Average Order Value 	| = Revenue |
|:-----:			|:-------:	|:-----------------:	|:---------------------:	|:---------:|
| <b>Ex 1.&emsp;</b> 		| 163,052 	|       4.07%       	|         $1,016        	|  $6.75mm  |

<br />
Go ahead, use your calculator to check the equation. Other than a small rounding error, it’s pretty doggone close.

<b>So why is this important? Because if you can positively affect just one of the variables on the left, you will increase your revenue.</b>


Let’s think of some other examples that affect each of the variables and see how it then affects revenue:

Ex 2.    You start AdWords campaigns to bid on keywords for products you sell on your website yielding a 10% increase in website traffic:

|      				|  Visits 	| x Conversion Rate 	| x Average Order Value 	| = Revenue |
|:-----:			|:-------:	|:-----------------:	|:---------------------:	|:---------:|
| <b>Ex 2.&emsp;</b> 		| 179,357 	|       4.07%       	|         $1,016        	|  $7.42mm  |

<br />
Boom! You just increased revenue by $670k.


Ex 3.    You hire a consultant to perform conversion rate optimization on your checkout steps and see a 0.5% increase in conversion rate:

|      				|  Visits 	| x Conversion Rate 	| x Average Order Value 	| = Revenue |
|:-----:			|:-------:	|:-----------------:	|:---------------------:	|:---------:|
| <b>Ex 3.&emsp;</b>		| 179,357 	|       4.57%       	|         $1,016        	|  $8.33mm  |

<br />
How about another increase in revenue of $910k?


Ex 4.    You implement a product recommendation engine on your website resulting in a 30% lift in your average order value:

|      				|  Visits 	| x Conversion Rate 	| x Average Order Value 	| = Revenue |
|:-----:			|:-------:	|:-----------------:	|:---------------------:	|:---------:|
| <b>Ex 4.&emsp;</b> 		| 179,357 	|       4.57%       	|         $1,321        	|  $10.83mm  |

<br />
That’s more than a significant increase of $2.5mm, and an overall increase in revenue of $4.1mm by compounding three changes that affect each of the variables.

Obviously these examples are academic, and the numbers aren’t as clean as portrayed above -- for example, if you increase the number of unqualified visitors to your website then you are bound to also increase the bounce rate which in turn decreases your conversion rate -- but you should be able to see the value of focusing your team on just three variables to increase your revenue.
